            <p class="review_text">&emsp; Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie about many things. It is a space oera about evolution, innovation, man's intelligence and tools, articial intelligence, aliens, time travel, and the meaning of life. This movie explores
                so many themes in a very implicit way. The film introduces the viewer to an idea or image and mesmerizes them with amazing visuals and music. There isn't a clear meaning or takeaway but plenty of room for the viewer to make their own judgement
                of what they've seen. This is true for many Stanly Kubrick films but 2001: A Space Odyssey does this so well with these themes.</p>

            <p class="review_text">&emsp; My favorite scenes in the movie included shots with the Monolith. The Monolith is the large smooth inexplicable structure that makes multiple appearances in the film. Every time it shows up, mankind makes a large leap forward in technology
                and civilization. I believe its implied that this Monolith is the reason mankind is able to evolve and it facilitates human advancement. Who placed this Monolith and why its there is left unanswered. The movie wraps up with some trippy
                space exploration and time travel sequences which are mesmerizing and confusing as hell. The end of the film leaves you with more questions than answers and like any classic Stanley Kubrick film, you are left thinking about this movie
                for the next few days. Its truly a fantastic film that holds up amazingly well and worth revisit every 5 to 10 years. I love this movie because it was so innovative for a film that came out before humans even landed on the moon. It talked
                about articificial intelligence and the existential doom of smart computers before anybody was really thinking about it. I'm sure this film inspired a genre of sci-fi creators as well as many acid trips and existential feelings for generations
                to follow.</p>
